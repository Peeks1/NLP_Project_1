Comparing original lemmas in the substring and words in the excerpts gives a more high level overview of the similarities, as this helps capture the similarities in meaning rather than just structure. This metric also reveals that the two speeches are very similar. From looking at the list of lemmas in common, both speeches have \"work\", \"hard\", \"respect\", \"promise\", and \"bond\". Considering how short this substring is, it's clear that they both must have the same message if they have these highly specific lemmas in common. The words in common in the full excerpts give further confirmation of this, as this list contains all the past lemmas and addionally has \"parents\", \"values\", and \"morals\". To get a numerical sense of how many lemmas and words are in common, below is a list of each speechs' number of lemmas and words."

An edit can be the addition of a character, the deletion of a character, or the conversion of one character to another. For example, the distance between the strings \"bleed\" and \"read\" would be calculated by doing the following conversions: \"bleed\" -> \"rleed\" -> \"reed\" -> \"read\". This conversion had two conversions and one deletion, making the distance between the words 3. The algorithm is useful for finding strings that are similar, as a low distance between documents indicates that there are not many character differences between them."
